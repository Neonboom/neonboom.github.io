    <h2 style="color:red;text-align:center">Ready Player One</h2>
    <p style="color:darkgray;text-align:center">By: Austin Smith</p>

	   <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">    I chose this book because my friends and family told me it was about this kid in a video game and I was totally going to read it. This book is fantasy and adventure, it takes place in 2043-2044 and that hasnt happened yet as of 2018:2:25 =D. </p>

        <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">The theme of this book is, to be strong and keep pursuing. Wade (Parzival) keeps trying to keep the Sixers (IOI) from winning, he doesnt give up. The setting of this book is in lots of different places, the OASIS, a virtual reality world that isnt real. Columbus, Ohio, where Wade buys his apartment and goes to the IOI. This is all in 2043-44. The plot of this book is, Wade, Parzival, lives in these RV towers. The world is at a time when everything is getting destroyed and ruined. Every day, almost, he goes to his secret hiding spot and plays the virtual reality game called, the OASIS. The OASIS is a world full of worlds. Wade goes to school there and does everything there. The creator of the game, James Holliday, was a multi-billionaire and died from an illness. He said that whoever could find all of the three hidden keys in the OASIS would get his entire fortune and control of the entire OASIS. Wade finds the first key and you will have to read the book to find out if he wins or not =D. The characters in this book are, Wade (parzival), he is the main character. Art3mis, or Samantha is Wades girlfriend. Aech, or Helen (SPOILER!!!) is Wades best friend. Og, or Ogden Marrow, is Hollidays best friend and one of the creators of the OASIS. Nolan Sorrento is the CEO of the IOI.  And Wades aunt, Alice.</p>

        <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">    I loved this story because it was about a virtual reality world and technology and I totally love that kind of stuff =D. I think the best part of the book is at the end when the High Fivers are fighting the IOI with everyone at their side. I felt scared at some parts of this book because I was worried Wade and some other people were going to die. I would totally recommend this book to friends, it was AWESOME. Yes, his writing was super descriptive and I could imagine what was going on really well. I learned that If you try hard to do something you will do it.</p>

    <h2 style="color:yellow;text-align:center">Energy Drinks</h2>
     <p style="color:darkgray;text-align:center;">By: Austin Smith</p>
    
	   <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">Have you ever thought about energy drinks? Do you think that they are more helpful or hurtful? In this paper you will learn how energy drinks are more hurtful than helpful. First, they can increase your blood pressure. Second, they can trigger the fight-or-flight hormone. Last, what is in the drink?</p>
    
	   <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">Some scientists did a test and found that in 30 minutes, an energy drink can send your heart rate up. Your blood pressure is just how much pressure there is in your blood vessels. If you have a higher blood pressure, you have a greater chance of having heart problems. In the test that they did they gave a placebo drink to some people, and an energy drink to the others. The ones who drank the placebo, rose about half as much as the ones who drank the energy drink. The drinks that they gave them both raised their heart beat, the energy drink rose about three more BPM (beats per minute). The ones who drank the placebo raised about four more BPM.</p>
    
	   <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">Energy drinks can activate an hormone called the fight-or-flight hormone. This activates when your body feels like it is in danger. This hormone tells your body to either fight, or run. This isnt always something you want to feel. You could get into a fight with someone or freak out about some little thing.</p>
    
	   <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">	Have you ever wondered what was in your energy drink? Well, caffeine is obvious, and you probably think that is the thing in your drink that is really hurting you. But, it's not, in DID YOU KNOW.? Top 10 Facts About Caffeine and Energy Drinks, By The American Beverage Association, it says, Caffeine is a safe ingredient. In fact, caffeine is safely consumed every day, in a wide variety of foods and beverages. It has been consumed by BILLIONS of people around the world  and has been for HUNDREDS of years.. </p>
    
	   <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">	In conclusion, energy drinks are hurtful to you. In this paper you learned that, first, they can increase your blood pressure. Second, they can trigger the fight-or-flight hormone. Last, you learned what is in the drink.</p>

    <h2 style="color:sandybrown;text-align:center">"Practice Makes Perfect"</h2>
     <p style="color:darkgray;text-align:center">By: Austin Smith</p>
        
        <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">	Youve probably heard of the saying practice makes perfect. While that is definitely true, there are other thing that come into play as well. You might think that gold medal winners do way more practice than silver winners. Sometimes that can be true but for the most part they do almost the same amount. In this paper you will learn about the 10,000-hour rule, how practice effects achievement, and how practice isnt the only thing that can make a difference in your performance.</p>
        
        <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">	The 10,000-hour rule is where if you practice for 10,000 hours, you should do well in whatever you are practicing for. The idea was thought of by a Swedish psychologist, K. Anders Ericsson in 1993. This is true in almost everything, for example, music, sports, chess, dance, and doctors.</p>
        
        <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">  Practice can make a huge impact in your overall ability. When you practice, you are improving your strength and you usually improve your technique. You are improving your strength by practicing because you are moving your body, and you are improving your technique by getting it in your head what you are doing.</p>
        
        <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">	You might think that if someone practiced 10 hours more than someone else, they will obviously win. But, that isnt always true. There are some other things that can have an effect on someones performance too. For example, in, Gold medal winners don't necessarily practice more than silver winners, By Scientific American, adapted by Newsela staff, it says, A person's DNA could make a difference too. The traits they inherited from their parents could have made them very good..</p>
        
        <p style="color:white;margin-right:75px;margin-left:75px">	In conclusion, gold medal winners, don't always have more practice than silver or bronze winners. In this paper you learned about the 10,000-hour rule, how practice effects achievement, and how practice isnt the only thing that can make a difference in your performance.</p>
